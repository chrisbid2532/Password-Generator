# Password-Generator
This is the third homework assignment I completed in my Coding Bootcamp for the University of Minnesotta. I created this repository to show my progress in the bootcamp course for any portential employers I might have. In this assignment, I was tasked with writing the JavaScript code for a password generator website. 

## Installation
N/A

## Credits
I used W3 Schools to help further my knowledge of 'if' statements in JavaScript

I also used W3 Schools again to help me understand how/where/when to use the proper random code in this assignment
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp

This was my main source which is heavily altered to help meet the acceptance criteria of the assignment

I was also helped by my peers.
